## Welcome to My Project

This project utilized AngularJS to construct a Contact Form.  The Contact Form had built-in alert error messages related to faulty email and website address entries. A participant could not submit their entries until a valid name, email address, website address and any form of comment were supplied. Valid submissions became live, stored data in the (Parse) database.
